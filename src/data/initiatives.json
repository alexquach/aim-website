        "description": "Our weekly discussions on recent machine learning papers, called ‚Äúreading groups‚Äù, are at the core of our community. We strongly believe that undergrads have the potential to do meaningful contributions in the field of ML. Because of that we organize reading groups for undergrads, lead by undergrads. We are confident that this is one of the best ways for undergrads to have a taste of the current literature, while joining a vibrant community."

        "description": "We host machine learning workshops every two weeks on Mondays from 7-9pm ET. Our workshops are designed to be both beginner-friendly and complementary to 6.036, MIT's introductory ML class; we focus on practical knowledge, ranging from basic model architectures and PyTorch best practices to model serving and distributed training. Each workshop is comprised of a brief theory lecture and an interactive coding-based lab. Materials can be found at github.com/AI-Club-at-MIT/Workshops."

        "description": "Generator is MIT‚Äôs premiere research competition intended to recognize promising students who are improving artifical intelligence (AI) and/or harnessing it to solve societal challenges. We provide mentorship from both industry professionals and academic researchers, cloud compute resources, and access to our events and speaker series. Generator empowers students across the Boston area to pursue technical and creative excellence in meaningful long-term projects.

        "description": "Machine learning (ML) algorithms are advancing quickly. They‚Äôre powering applications in every industry, and will only become more ubiquitous over the next few years. However, at MIT, ML work is primarily theoretical and research-based. AIM Labs' aim is to bring a more practical focus to MIT. We are building a community of talented, passionate hackers, working together to use cutting-edge ML in public-facing projects. Every semester, we host a demo day and invite the community to see what we‚Äôve been building! ü•≥"
